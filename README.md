# Yet Another RDF Stream Processing Engine: YASPER

YASPER is an RDF Stream Processing (RSP) Engine that aims at providing full support for RSP-QL. 
It is inspired by OWL API, a generic library for OWL 2 reasoning. It provide an API to which any existing
RSP engine can (we hope) bind itself to and, therefore, standardize the interaction.

YASPER is an open and ongoing project. we Welcome adoption as well as suggestion or request.
